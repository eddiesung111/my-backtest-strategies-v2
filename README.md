# My Backtest Strategies v2: A Backtrader Framework

A robust and extensible framework for developing, testing, and analyzing quantitative trading strategies using the Backtrader library. This project provides a structured environment for quickly implementing new strategies, running comprehensive backtests, and generating detailed performance reports and visualizations.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Modular Strategy Development:** Easily define and integrate new trading strategies.
* **Automated Backtesting:** Run multiple strategies against historical data with configurable parameters.
* **Comprehensive Performance Analysis:** Utilize Backtrader's built-in analyzers for key metrics (Returns, Sharpe Ratio, Drawdown, SQN, etc.).
* **Detailed Trade Logging:** Custom observer to capture and export individual trade details (entry/exit dates, prices, PnL, etc.).
* **`pytest`-Based Testing:** Ensure the reliability and correctness of your strategies and core components.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project and run your first backtest.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Recommended versions are **Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12**. While Python 3.13 may be used, `backtrader` and its dependencies might exhibit compatibility issues.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eddiesung111/my-backtest-strategies-v2.git
cd my-backtest-strategies-v2
```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
Before installing any packages or running scripts, you must activate the virtual environment.

* On macOS / Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

* On Windows (Command Prompt):
```DOS
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
You will know the virtual environment is active when your terminal prompt changes to include (.venv) (or similar) at the beginning.

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install `backtrader`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and any other required libraries.

## ðŸ§  Strategies Implemented

This framework includes the following trading strategies:

* **BuyHold:** A baseline strategy that simply buys and holds the asset for the entire backtest period.
* **SMAGoldenCross:** A trend-following strategy based on the crossover of two Simple Moving Averages.
* **EMAGoldenCross:** A trend-following strategy based on the crossover of two Exponential Moving Averages.
* **MACDStrategy:** Utilizes the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator for momentum and trend signals.
* **RSIStrategy:** Employs the Relative Strength Index to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.

For detailed descriptions, logic, and parameters of each strategy, refer to the [Strategies documentation](https://github.com/eddiesung111/my-backtest-strategies-v2/blob/main/docs/strategies.md).

## Run the program
You can simply use the following command to run the program.
```bash
python3 src/backtest_strategies/run [Strategies]
```
Strategies could be:
* BuyHold
* EMAGoldenCross
* MACDStrategy
* RSIStrategy
* SMAGoldenCross

## âœ… Testing

The project includes a test suite to ensure the correctness and reliability of the strategies and core components.

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```
